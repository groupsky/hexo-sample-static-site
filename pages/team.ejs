                <small class="text-muted">Erik has been programming for fun since 1980 and for profit since 1989, when he started his first development company. Erik was one of the driving forces behind the the "High Performance Erlang project" (HiPE) since it started in 1996. In his PhD work he implemented an efficient native code compiler, compiling from the Erlang VM BEAM code to native machine code. Erik built up the Engineering Department at Klarna from scratch. In his limited spare time, he is writing a book about the Erlang Runtime system.</small>
