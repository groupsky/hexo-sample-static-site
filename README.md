# Sophia language website

The website is created using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

## Quick Start

**Start the server**

``` bash
$ hexo server
```

**Deploy**

``` bash
$ yarn deploy
```
or

``` bash
$ npm run deploy
```

Troubleshooting:
If the deploy throws an error that it doesn't detect your GitHub username and email then you can add them to deploy section of _config.yml. You may need to delete .deploy_git/ and run the deploy command again.
